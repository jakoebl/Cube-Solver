To run the solver (main) you need to have all lookups (g1 - g4), generate_g1, generate_g2, move_tables, and facelet_manipulation in the same folder.

To solve a cube enter the first letter of the colours of the stickers in the order of the Speffz lettering scheme (https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Speffz)
starting with the white side, then red, green, orange, blue, and yellow. 

Then choose a move representation for the output:

'arduino' for the single letter representation

'index' for the move index notation

Any other string for the Singmaster notation
